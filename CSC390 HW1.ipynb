In order to gives the reader the news that he or she cares most, the system will usually store the past search history and used machine learning algorithms to find the pattern. Another portion of AI that it may involves in this process is natural language processing where large stream of text and news are processed for machine to understand and based on corpus database, render human redeable sentences draw from the data."

I found this really exciting, as it might be crucial for the advancement of AI.With this new technic, machines can automatically applied exisiting algorithms to any new programs without worrying about changing variables or link with new data set.\n",

    "The implementation is primarily associated with finding the patterns and correspondences between the variables in both programs and then translating operations. Right now, the system works well with organized programs and data sources such as image processing. In the future, if the programs can be more flexible to adopt operations with various data patterns, it will be of great help to fully used open source program and propel the programs to \"learn by them self\"."
